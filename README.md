# How to Contribute to this project?
Step 1: Make sure you have the Base.py file with you.

Step 2: Go throght the code. You don't have to understand everything, just know how the program carries out the tasks given to it.

Step 3: Make a \_\_init\_\_.py file in the directory where you have your Base.py copied.

Step 4: Write a plugin class in a separate file. Refer to the example SearchPugin.py file ( Also provided to you by the author in person.)

Step 5: After you finish writing your code, contact the author of Base.py to include that in the Base.py file so that it be able to run in the program.
